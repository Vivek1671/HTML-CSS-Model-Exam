                <p>The sacrifice made by the women of India has occupied the foremost place. 
                    They fought with true spirit and undaunted courage and faced various tortures, exploitations and hardships to earn us freedom. The entire history of the freedom movement is replete with the saga of bravery, sacrifice and political sagacity of hundreds and thousands of women in our country. 
                    Woman's participation in India's freedom struggle began as early as 1817 when Bhima Bai Holkar fought bravely against the British colonel Malcolm and defeated him in guerilla warfare. 
                    Many women including Rani Channama of Kittur, and Rani Begam Hazrat Mahal of Avadh fought against the British East India Company in the 19th century,30 years before the “First War of Independence 1857”. 
                    So in this article, we are discussing the Female or Women's Freedom Fighters of India who paled a major role in Indian history.</p>

                    <p>The summary of Female Freedom Fighters of India is already discussed above. If you want to complete information about the Indian women freedom fighters, read the complete article.
                         Here, we have discussed the all-female or women freedom fighters of India in detail.</p>
                    <h2 id=" Rani Laxmi Bai"> Rani Laxmi Bai</h2>
                    <p>No other woman warrior in the history of India has made such a powerful impact on the minds of the Indian people as the Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmi Bai. She was the second wife of the ruler of Jhansi Raja Gangadhar Rao who protested against the ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. She refused to surrender Jhansi and fought bravely attired as a male during the Revolt of 1857 and died on the battlefield fighting the British forces.
                        Her courage inspired many Indians to rise against the alien rule.</p>
                    <h2 id=" Begum Hazrat Mahal"> Begum Hazrat Mahal</h2>
                    <p>Another woman whom we remember in this context was Hazrat Mahal Begum. She was the wife of the deposed ruler of Lucknow who actively took part in the revolt of 1857 against the Doctrine of Lapse under which Dalhousie wanted her to surrender Lucknow. She gave stiff resistance. 
                        But after the fall of Lucknow, she escaped to Kathmandu.</p>
